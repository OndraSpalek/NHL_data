NHL_dashboard:
The report is designed to support predictions of shots and minor penalties (two-minute) in NHL games during the 2025/26 season. It always displays the last five games of the teams scheduled to play against each other, providing a basis for forecasting shots and penalties. The report is not automatically updated, which means there is always a delay between the most recent games and those shown in the report.
